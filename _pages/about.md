I am working as a Software Engineer for AI training data (remote) at Scale AI in San Francisco, California, USA. Additionally, I am working remotely as a teaching assistant for a professor at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology in Pennsylvania. Previously, I worked as an intern at Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh.

My primary research interests are in AI4SE, Smell Detection (code and community smells), Generative AI, and HCI. Iâ€™m particularly focused on how Generative AI can enhance human-computer interaction and drive innovative solutions, while also exploring smell detection to improve code quality and team collaboration.
