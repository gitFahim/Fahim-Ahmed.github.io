I am working as a Software Engineer for AI training data (remote) at Scale AI in San Francisco, California, USA. Additionally, I am working remotely as a teaching assistant for a professor at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology in Pennsylvania. Previously, I worked as an intern at Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh.

My primary research interests are in Human-Computer Interaction, Generative AI, Accessibility, Smell Detection, and Learning Analytics. Iâ€™m particularly focused on how Generative AI and HCI can enhance user experiences, improve accessibility, and enable more effective detection of code and community smells, while leveraging learning analytics to drive data-informed improvements in education and software development. I am also part of a research community called - "Intelligent Systems and HCI Research Group".
